COMPREHENSIVE VAPING BEHAVIOR PREDICTION ANALYSIS
Enhanced Methodological Approach Following Best Practices
====================================================================================================

Analysis Date: 2025-10-30 01:45:30

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
• Dataset: 32,324 observations analyzed
• Target: Frequent vaping (≥20 days/month)
• Prevalence: 8.6%
• Best Model: Random Forest Tuned (AUC: 0.9692)
• Methodology: 60/40 train-test, 10-fold CV, SMOTE, comprehensive evaluation

KEY FINDINGS
---------------
1. Vaping behavior is highly predictable from multi-domain risk factors
2. Random Forest models achieve excellent discriminative performance
3. Multiple behavioral domains contribute to prediction accuracy
4. Sociodemographic interactions show intersectionality effects
5. Model performance is robust across validation approaches

METHODOLOGY HIGHLIGHTS
-------------------------
✓ Frequent vaping target (≥20 days/month) for clinical relevance
✓ Comprehensive feature categorization across behavioral domains
✓ Multiple imputation sensitivity analysis
✓ 60/40 train-test split with 10-fold cross-validation
✓ SMOTE oversampling for class balance
✓ Advanced interpretability with SHAP and partial dependence
✓ Intersectionality analysis of sociodemographic interactions
✓ Comprehensive sensitivity analyses

CLINICAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
-----------------------------------
• Multi-domain prevention programs likely most effective
• Early identification possible through risk factor screening
• Intersectionality considerations important for equity
• Model could support clinical decision-making
• Population-level surveillance applications possible

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
-----------------------------------
• Cross-sectional design limits causal inference
• External validation in other populations needed
• Temporal validation for longitudinal prediction
• Integration with electronic health records
• Real-world implementation feasibility studies
