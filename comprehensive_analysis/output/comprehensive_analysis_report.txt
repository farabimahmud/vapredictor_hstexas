EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
• Dataset: 32,324 observations analyzed (Texas Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 2001-2019)
• Target: Ever vaped e-cigarettes (8.56% prevalence, adapted from frequent vaping due to low prevalence)
• Feature Space: 157 variables across 13 behavioral domains after removing high-missingness features
• Best Model: XGBoost Classifier (AUC: 0.9697, 94.86% accuracy)
• Model Comparison: XGBoost > Random Forest (0.9694) > AdaBoost (0.9578) > Logistic Regression (0.9567)
• Methodology: 70/30 train-test split, SMOTE oversampling, comprehensive feature importance analysis

KEY FINDINGS
---------------
1. Excellent predictive performance achieved across all machine learning models (AUC > 0.95)
2. XGBoost achieved the highest discriminative performance (AUC: 0.9697)
3. Top predictors span multiple behavioral domains with substance use variables dominant
4. Key predictors include:
   - Substance Use: Age of first cigarette exposure (q85), Lifetime cigarette use (qn85), Current cigarette use (q32)
   - Substance Use: Ever used hard drugs (q75), Binge drinking frequency (qn49)
   - Safety/Violence: Driving behaviors and risk-taking (q10, q11)
   - Mental Health: Suicide-related behaviors and depression (q26, qn31, q31)
5. Model performance is robust across different algorithmic approaches
6. Feature importance patterns are consistent between tree-based models
7. Complex interactions captured effectively by ensemble methods
